    title: "א",
    info: `א (Aleph): Originally representing a glottal stop sound (/ʔ/), similar
        to the sound between the syllables of the English word "uh-oh". The
        letter Aleph represents an "a" vowel and is a vowel place holder before or after the other vowels /o/ or /e/ in various positions within
        words. For example, in the word אור (or), meaning "light," the Aleph
        represents the vowel placeholder helping the waw create the "oh"
        sound. If the aleph was not present then this sound could not be
        achievable with the waw in the first letter position.`,
        sound: `[ɒ]: as in "hot"`
  },
  {
    title: "ו",
    info: `ו (Waw): While primarily a consonant representing the /w/ sound, the
        letter Waw can also represent the vowel sounds /o/ or /u/. In
        antiquity, the vowel is primarily an "Ō" sound, as in the word "coat."
        Over time, with the natural evolution of this vowel, we have the /u/
        sound, as in the word "noob." This evolution occurs naturally within
        speech and can cause the listener to perceive a shift from the natural
        /ō/ vowel. For instance, in the phrase "לרוץ" (la'rotz) meaning "to
        run," the Waw, represents the /ō/ vowel , but with natural vowel reduction,
        this vowel becomes less distinct and may sound like the /u/ vowel.`,
        sound: `[oʊ]: as in "go"`
  },
  {
    title: "י",
    info: `י (Yod): Besides functioning as a consonant representing the /y/
        sound, the letter "yod" can indicate the vowel sounds /i/ or /e/. In
        words like בֵית (beith), meaning "house," the Yod represents the vowel
        /e/.`,
        sound: `[eɪ]: as in "say"`
  },
  {
    title: "ה",
    info: `Heh serves both as an exasperated breath and a vowel placeholder to
    avoid doubling an additional cosonant sound. It extends vowel sounds and
    adds emphasis to them. Doubling it fully as an "hah" sound would make it
    too similar to the aleph. In modern Hebrew, this issue is addressed by
    making the aleph silent and allowing the "heh" to function as a
    consonant. When heh is at the beginning of a word, it functions as a consonant. When it
    occurs within words, it serves as a vowel extender or emphasis marker
    for that specific vowel. When at the end of a word it serves as a silent
    vowel placeholder for whatever letter precedes it.`,
        sound: `"The breath"`
