              Admixture in genetics refers to the process by which two or more
              previously isolated populations begin interbreeding, resulting in
              the introduction of new genetic lineages into a population. This
              gene mixing significantly impacts the genetic makeup of the
              resulting population, influencing traits, genetic diversity, and
              evolutionary outcomes.

            <p>
              In modern times, admixture occurs through the interbreeding of
              individuals from different backgrounds. For example, due to
              colonization, a significant percentage of African Americans have
              European DNA in their genomes. This pattern is also seen in other
              populations that have experienced colonization and forced
              interbreeding.

              Modern science has concluded that Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA is
              mixed into the modern human genome. However, there are no pure
              Neanderthal, Denisovan, or other ancient lineages alive today.
              Instead, their genetic material exists in small percentages within
              our DNA.

              As it is writtem in Thorah (Genesis 6:4), "The Nephilim ("The
              Fallen") were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when
              the sons of Elohim came in to the daughters of men, and they bore
              children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men
              of renown." This intermingling created various humanoid beings
              with distinct DNA and lineage of "The Fallen." These genes live on
              in varying percentages within us.
            </p>
            <p>
              The flood described in religious texts is said to have eliminated
              the pure lineages of "The Fallen." However, Noah, his three sons,
              and their wives contained an admixture of these ancient genes.
              Some of their descendants expressed these genes more than others. which is why after the flood the rephaim and children of Anak existed

              Admixture is a fundamental process in genetics that shapes the
              genetic structure of populations through the interbreeding of
              distinct groups. It has significant implications for genetic
              diversity, trait variation, health, and evolutionary history,
              making it a crucial area of study in genetics, anthropology,
              medicine, and conservation.
