        The law allows for four creepers that fly to be acceptable for
        consumption. This is based off of their three pairs of legs not for
        locomotion but to “lunge/jump” with. The locus and the grasshopper share
        the same structure and anatomy but are fundamentally different with
        genetic coding based off of a release of seratonin. grasshoppers are
        solitary but when activated their genetic coding changes and the
        seratonon released in their bodies turn them into swarming locusts whose
        appetite is beyond compare.
