        unclean are they for you all, all who touch on their dead carcasses will
        be unclean until the sunset. And who carries their dead bodies will wash
        his clothes and be unclean until the sunset. they are unclean to you
        all.”</em>

        The fifth category deals with non-flying terrestrial quadrupeds
        with paws such as cats, dogs, foxes, hedgehogs, wolves, lions, bears,
        lions, etc. They do not have human-like hands, or opposable thumbs or
        fingers, for grasping and vertical climbing. It is permissible to keep
        and to handle them as domesticated animals, but when they die they must
        not be touched and the one who has to touch them in order to remove them
        must wash his clothes and be unclean until the sunset.
