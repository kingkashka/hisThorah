      <p>1. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
      <p>
        2. Speak to the children of Israel, saying: If a woman conceives and
        gives birth to a male, she shall be unclean for seven days; as [in] the
        days of her menstrual flow, she shall be unclean.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. And on the eighth day, the flesh of his foreskin shall be
        circumcised.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. And for thirty three days, she shall remain in the blood of purity;
        she shall not touch anything holy, nor may she enter the Sanctuary,
        until the days of her purification have been completed.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. And if she gives birth to a female, she shall be unclean for two
        weeks, like her menstruation [period]. And for sixty six days, she shall
        remain in the blood of purity.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. And when the days of her purification have been completed, whether
        for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring a sheep in its first year
        as a burnt offering, and a young dove or a turtle dove as a sin
        offering, to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, to the kohen.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. And he shall offer it up before the Lord and effect atonement for
        her, and thus, she will be purified from the source of her blood. This
        is the law of a woman who gives birth to a male or to a female.
      </p>
      <p>
        8. And if she cannot afford a sheep, she shall take two turtle doves or
        two young doves: one as a burnt offering and one as a sin offering. And
        the kohen shall effect atonement for her, and she shall become clean.
